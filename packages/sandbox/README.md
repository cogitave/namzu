Runs a tool call somewhere that is not your process. Two isolation tiers
over four backends, a bounded filesystem view, and an egress boundary the
run cannot talk its way past.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @namzu/sdk @namzu/sandbox
```

`@namzu/sdk` is a peer dependency. Install both.

## Usage

```ts
import { createSandboxProvider } from '@namzu/sandbox'

declare const taskId: string

const provider = createSandboxProvider({
  backend: {
    tier: 'container',
    runtime: 'docker',
    image: 'namzu-sandbox:latest',
    network: 'namzu-tasks',
    labels: { 'example.task-id': taskId },
  },
  layout: {
    outputs: { source: { type: 'hostDir', hostPath: `/srv/tasks/${taskId}/outputs` } },
    uploads: { source: { type: 'hostDir', hostPath: `/srv/tasks/${taskId}/uploads` } },
  },
  defaultEgress: { kind: 'static', allowedHosts: ['api.example.com'] },
  defaultMemoryLimitMb: 1024,
  defaultMaxProcesses: 128,
})
```

## Cancellation and worker compatibility

Pass `SandboxExecOptions.signal` to stop a command on any shipped backend. A
remote host reserves every command before admission and the container worker or
microVM guest confirms process-group termination over a separate cancellation
request; stopping the data-stream wait alone is never reported as stopping the
command. A stalled execution stream is bounded relative to the requested
command timeout and reconciled through that same control path. An unconfirmed
stop fences the handle and retires the whole container, container group, or
microVM; a confirmed stop with an incomplete terminal stream is reported
separately so callers do not mistake partial output for an unknown process
outcome.

Remote peers retain terminal ids briefly for idempotent cancellation, but evict
the oldest terminal history before refusing new work. If a command leader exits
while descendants remain, the peer fences itself and retires the whole sandbox
instead of signalling a numeric process-group id that the kernel could reuse.
Concurrent destroy and automatic-retirement calls share one checked teardown;
Docker removal is never reported as accepted after a non-zero or aborted
`docker rm -f`.

The cancellation path requires a worker or guest image built from the same
release. A current host explicitly detects an older peer and remains compatible
with legacy no-signal execution, but a signal sent to that peer is refused with
a rebuild instruction. For a standby pool, publish a new container group
profile revision containing the current worker before enabling cancellation;
for a microVM deployment, rebuild its golden guest image.
