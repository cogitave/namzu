# Kubernetes sandboxes

`@namzu/sandbox` can acquire a sandbox from a Kubernetes cluster running the
[agent-sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox) controller
(v1.0.2). Sandboxes are claimed out of a `SandboxWarmPool`, which is how the
acquire stays inside a second, and the pod runs under whatever `RuntimeClass`
the cluster's `SandboxTemplate` names — a Kata class makes the boundary a
hardware-virtualized guest rather than a namespace.

**This page describes a first batch.** Acquire, readiness, address resolution
and teardown are implemented. The execution surface is not: see
[what is not here yet](#what-is-not-here-yet) before wiring this into a host.

## Configure a provider

```ts
import { createSandboxProvider } from '@namzu/sandbox'

const provider = createSandboxProvider({
  backend: {
    tier: 'microvm',
    service: 'kubernetes',
    namespace: 'namzu-sandboxes',
    access: { inCluster: true },
    sandboxTemplateName: 'namzu-task',
    warmPoolName: 'namzu-task-pool',
  },
})
```

The tier is `microvm` because `SandboxTier` names the strength of the boundary,
not the orchestrator behind it. It is also why this backend needs no
`ContainerSandboxLayout`: like the Firecracker backend, it ships files over the
guest agent rather than bind-mounting a host directory.

`access` has two arms and no third. `{ inCluster: true }` reads the projected
ServiceAccount volume and the kubelet's `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` /
`KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT`, and is resolved while the provider is being built —
configuring it outside a pod fails during wiring rather than on the first
`create()`. Everything else supplies its own credential:

```ts
import { createSandboxProvider } from '@namzu/sandbox'
import type { KubernetesClusterAccess } from '@namzu/sandbox'

const access: KubernetesClusterAccess = {
  server: 'https://cluster.example:6443',
  ca: process.env.CLUSTER_CA_PEM,
  getToken: async () => await mintClusterToken(),
}

const provider = createSandboxProvider({
  backend: {
    tier: 'microvm',
    service: 'kubernetes',
    namespace: 'namzu-sandboxes',
    access,
    sandboxTemplateName: 'namzu-task',
    warmPoolName: 'namzu-task-pool',
    claimTtlSeconds: 1_800,
  },
})

declare function mintClusterToken(): Promise<string>
```

`getToken` is called on every API request, so a rotating token survives a
long-lived host. There is no kubeconfig support in the package and none is
planned: context merging and exec-credential plugins (`kubelogin`, `gcloud`,
`aws-iam-authenticator`) live in the host that already owns them, which is how
this package still declares no runtime dependencies at all. When `ca` is
supplied the client dials through `node:https` instead of `fetch`, for the same
reason the Firecracker backend does.

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `namespace` | — | Claims, sandboxes and pods all live here. |
| `sandboxTemplateName` | — | Read only on the pool-less path (see below). |
| `warmPoolName` | unset | Unset means every create is a cold `Sandbox`. |
| `agentPort` | `1024` | The guest agent's TCP port — same number it uses over vsock on the Firecracker tier. |
| `readyPollIntervalMs` | `50` | A pool bind lands in ~120 ms; a half-second poll would sleep through the budget. |
| `readyTimeoutMs` | `60000` | Whole clock from create to an addressed, Ready sandbox. |
| `claimTtlSeconds` | `3600` | Wall-clock lifetime written into every created object. |
| `runtimeClassName` | unset | Pool-less path only — see [refusals](#what-it-refuses). |

## Two acquire paths

With `warmPoolName` set, `create()` POSTs a `SandboxClaim` at that pool and the
controller binds an already-running sandbox out of it. Without it, `create()`
POSTs a `Sandbox` directly. The second path is necessitated rather than
offered: `SandboxClaim.spec.warmPoolRef` is a required field, so a pool-less
claim does not exist in the API. It is also the slow path — it pays a full pod
start — and it is the only path that reads `sandboxTemplateName`, because
`Sandbox.spec` has no `templateRef` and the pod spec has to be copied across by
the client.

### The claim is pristine, and that is the whole trick

A `SandboxClaim` may carry `spec.env` and `spec.volumeClaimTemplates`. This
backend sets neither, ever. A claim that sets either is forced to cold-start
upstream instead of adopting a pool sandbox — it still works, it just stops
being fast, so nothing fails and only the latency shows it. The POSTed body is
asserted on the wire in
`backends/kubernetes/__tests__/acquire-warm-and-cold.test.ts` to contain
exactly `warmPoolRef` and `lifecycle` and nothing else.

### The bound sandbox is not named after the claim

A pool sandbox keeps the generated name the pool gave it when a claim adopts
it; only a cold-started one takes the claim's name. The backend reads the bound
identity back out of `status.sandbox` and uses that name as the sandbox `id`,
so an id in a log line is also a `kubectl get sandbox` argument. A backend that
derived the name from its own claim would address the right pod on every cold
start and the wrong one on every warm bind.

### Nothing is left behind

Every created object carries an absolute expiry (`shutdownTime`, one hour by
default) plus `shutdownPolicy: Delete`, so a host that dies mid-run costs the
cluster one expiry instead of a leaked sandbox. `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` is
deliberately **not** used for this: upstream starts that timer from the
`Finished` condition, which a crashed host never reaches.

On top of that, every failure on the create path — a readiness deadline, an
API error mid-poll, caller cancellation — deletes the object it created on a
separate short budget before the create promise rejects. A cleanup that reports
the object already gone is treated as success.

## The agent credential

The per-instance token the transport presents to the guest agent is the backing
pod's own `metadata.uid`. The host learns it with one `GET` after readiness;
the guest learns it through the downward API as `NAMZU_AGENT_BIND_TOKEN`. That
costs one round trip and no claim mutation, which is what keeps the claim
pristine — minting a token and injecting it as claim-level `env` would have
made every acquire a cold start.

In v1.0.2 the backing pod is named after its Sandbox, so the fast path is a
`GET` by that name. That is an observation of a released controller rather than
a documented guarantee, so a 404 there falls back to listing pods by
`Sandbox.status.selector`. A sandbox whose pod uid cannot be read at all is
refused rather than returned with no credential.

The primary boundary is still the network: a `NetworkPolicy` restricting the
agent port to the host's own pods. The bind token is defence in depth against a
co-tenant that satisfies that selector. It is **not** a boundary against the
sandbox's own workload — after deprivileging, the agent and the workload share
a uid — which is exactly why it must be per-instance and must never be a shared
secret baked into the pool's template.

## What it refuses

`SandboxBackendOptions` carries per-sandbox controls this backend cannot apply,
and it refuses them by name rather than accepting and dropping them:

- `env`, `memoryLimitMb`, `maxProcesses` — these would have to ride on the
  claim, and a claim that carries them cold-starts. They belong on the
  `SandboxTemplate` the pool is built from.
- `egress` — egress here is a `NetworkPolicy` attached to that template, which
  cannot be rewritten per running sandbox. The container tier's habit of
  emitting proxy environment variables as a substitute is not repeated.

`runtimeClassName` together with `warmPoolName` is refused at construction: a
pooled sandbox is already running under the `RuntimeClass` its template named,
and a claim cannot change it, so accepting it would quietly drop the choice of
VM boundary.

## RBAC

The ServiceAccount the host runs as needs, in the sandbox namespace:
`create`/`get`/`delete` on `sandboxclaims`, `create`/`get`/`delete` on
`sandboxes`, `get` on `sandboxtemplates`, and `get`/`list` on `pods`. No
consumer role is published upstream. A `403` surfaces as an error naming the
verb and the resource and never the token.

## What is not here yet

This batch delivers the config type, both acquire paths, readiness, address
resolution and teardown. Still to come, each in its own change:

- **The execution surface.** `exec`, `readFile`, `writeFile` and `listFiles`
  currently throw `KubernetesAgentTransportPendingError`, which names the
  missing transport rather than failing as an absent method. `destroy()` is
  real today.
- **Workspace lifecycle.** Suspend, resume, and a persistent block-mode disk.
- **Egress mapping.** Which `EgressPolicy` shapes a cluster can express, and
  which are refused because core `NetworkPolicy` has no hostname concept.
- **Cluster manifests.** The image, the `RuntimeClass`, `SandboxTemplate`,
  `SandboxWarmPool`, `NetworkPolicy` and RBAC the above assumes.
