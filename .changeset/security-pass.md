Close every open code-scanning finding

**Breaking:** `LocalExecutionContext.executeCommand` no longer interprets its arguments as shell syntax. `shell` defaulted to `true`, and spawning with a shell re-joins the command and its argument array into a single `sh -c` string — so every metacharacter inside an argument became syntax. An `args` array reads argv-safe and was not. The default is now `false`; `shell: true` remains available where a caller genuinely wants a pipeline. A consumer passing `"ls -la"` as one command string, or relying on glob expansion without asking for a shell, must now pass `shell: true`.

**A sandbox timeout is bounded, and an out-of-range one is refused.** The bash tool's `timeout` argument is a number the model writes, with no ceiling of its own, and it reached both sandbox transports unmodified — so a single call could pin a container or a guest for as long as the platform's timer honours. Both transports now refuse a non-finite, non-positive or over-thirty-minute request rather than clamping it: running under a deadline the caller never chose, and never learns about, is the "accepted and silently not applied" failure this codebase treats as worse than not offering the control at all.

**Seven quadratic-backtracking regexes are now linear scans**, each on a path an attacker can reach: shell output the agent captured, a tenant-supplied connector URL, a host-supplied workspace root, a model completion, and three endpoint strings that cross the same trust boundary. The worst measured over thirty seconds on a single pathological input, on a shared event loop. Three of the seven were not flagged by the scanner — the same pattern, the same boundary — and were fixed with the rest rather than left to be rediscovered.
