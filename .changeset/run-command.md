**`namzu run` — headless one-shot mode for scripts and CI.**

`namzu run "your prompt"` runs a single prompt through the same agent the TUI uses and prints the reply to stdout (the equivalent of claude-code's `--print`). The prompt can also come from stdin (`echo "…" | namzu run`), and `--format json` emits `{"text": "…"}`. Status lines go to stderr (silenced by `--quiet`), so stdout is just the answer. It's non-interactive (tools auto-run, but the safety gate still hard-denies catastrophic commands) and uses an ephemeral session, so one-shots don't clutter `/resume`.
