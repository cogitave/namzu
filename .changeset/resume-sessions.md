**`/resume` — continue a past conversation (SDK-backed sessions).**

namzu now persists each conversation to the SDK's session store (`DiskSessionStore`) under the working directory's `.namzu` — the same hierarchy `query()` writes its runs to, so a conversation's `session.json` and `runs/` live together. Every turn (your message + the reply) is appended to the active session.

`/resume` opens a Claude-Code-style picker of this folder's recent conversations (title + relative time); ↑/↓ navigate, Enter restores the transcript and continues in that session, Esc cancels. Each `cwd` is one project (a stable id kept in `.namzu/cli.json`); conversations are sessions under a shared CLI thread. This reuses the SDK's existing persistence rather than a parallel store.
