**Remove the legacy `append` file tool.** `AppendFileTool` is gone — it was already excluded from `getBuiltinTools()` (Claude Code's tool distribution has no `Append`), and appending is canonical `edit` with `insertLine: "end"`. The export is removed from the public surface; hosts that relied on it should switch to `edit`. namzu's CLI no longer needs to filter `append` out of its tool set.
