Harden two paths flagged by an adversarial review: `ToolRegistry.searchDeferred` no longer over-activates deferred tools — batched-query tokens match the tool name only (not descriptions) and short/generic tokens like `clawtool` are ignored, so a common word can't activate the whole catalog. The dynamic `Agent` sub-agent now unregisters its per-call `dyn-N` definition in a `finally`, so long sessions don't leak persona registrations on success, failure, or throw.
