**namzu can now delegate to sub-agents.**

The CLI wires the SDK's native delegation: the model gets the canonical `Agent({ description, prompt, subagent_type })` tool and can hand a self-contained task to a fresh `general-purpose` sub-agent that runs in its own context window with its own tools, then returns its result. Delegations show in the transcript as a normal `Agent(...)` tool call with a live spinner and result.

To support this from a host, `@namzu/sdk` now exports `ThreadManager` and `InMemoryThreadStore` from its public runtime surface (alongside the already-public `AgentManager`, `AgentRegistry`, `ReactiveAgent`, `LocalTaskGateway`, `buildAgentTool`, and the session/summary/capacity/workspace primitives) so a consumer can stand up an `AgentManager` end to end.
