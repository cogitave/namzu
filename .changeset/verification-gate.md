**Safety gate: catastrophic shell commands are hard-denied before they run.**

namzu now runs every tool call through the SDK's verification gate. Read-only tools auto-run; a narrow set of catastrophic patterns — `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, fork bombs, `sudo`/`su -`, `chmod 777 /`, `curl|sh` / `wget|sh`, `ssh user@host`, dynamic `eval` — are **hard-denied** and never execute; everything else still goes to the approval prompt. The deny rule applies even under `--dangerously-skip-permissions` / `--yolo`, so bypass mode can't brick the machine. (The list is narrow: `rm -rf node_modules` and the like are unaffected.)
