**Paste images into the conversation (vision input).**

A user message can now carry image attachments. `@namzu/sdk` adds an optional `attachments` field to user messages (`ImageAttachment { data, mediaType }`, additive — text messages are unchanged), and the Anthropic provider sends them as image content blocks so the model can see them. In the CLI, press `Ctrl+V` to paste an image from the clipboard — it shows as an `⎘ Image #N` chip in the composer and is sent to the model as vision input when you submit.
