Four defects an adversarial audit confirmed

**A task could be created and then never found again.** `DiskTaskStore` writes under the run that created it and read only under the store's default run, so every lookup missed as soon as the two differed — the normal case, since the task tools are built with the live run id while a long-lived host constructs the store once with a fixed default. `create` succeeded, `list` succeeded, and `update`, `delete`, `claim` and every dependency link answered "not found" for a task the caller could see. The in-memory store keys by task id alone, which is why nothing caught it.

**A sub-agent's token reservation was never returned.** The debit at spawn reserves headroom so siblings cannot each be promised the same tokens, and nothing credited back the unused part — so a pool shrank by the full allocation on every spawn no matter what the child used. At a half-pool fraction, ten delegations left a parent with a thousandth of its budget and the next spawn was refused for a budget that had barely been spent. The debit also ran before provisioning, so a spawn rejected for capacity still burned its allocation — the one state change the comment there promised would not happen.

**A failed sandbox create leaked a proxy holding real credentials.** The egress proxy starts before the container and its only close was in `destroy()`, which a create that never returned can never reach. Every failure in between left a listening server on loopback stamping credential headers, plus a retained event-loop handle, one per retry.

**A remembered approval could overrule the operator.** The grant check ran before the verification gate and returned, so a remembered approval skipped the gate entirely — and because a tool-scoped grant matches any arguments, approving one harmless invocation authorised every other one, past a rule written to stop exactly that. The gate now runs first, and a grant can satisfy a review but never a denial.
